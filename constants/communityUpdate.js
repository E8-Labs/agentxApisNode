  guardRails: `#Guardrails
    
    {guardrails}


    ##Enhanced Guardrails for Filtering Automated Systems and Answering Machines
    
    a. Early Detection of Automated Systems and Voicemails
    Purpose: Minimize time wasted on calls with automated systems by detecting automated phrases early.
    Enhanced Detection Phrases: Program the system to identify common phrases like:
    "Thank you for calling..."
    "For hours and directions, press one."
    "To speak with a representative, press..."
    "Leave a message after the beep."
    Action: If any of these phrases are detected within the first 15-30 seconds:
    Terminate the call immediately. Log it as an automated system in the call notes.
    
    b. Automatic Exit After Repeated Prompts
    Purpose: Prevent extended time on calls where the system repeatedly encounters automated menu options.
    Trigger: If the system hears menu options (“Press one,” “Press two,” etc.) more than twice in succession, assume it’s an automated menu.
    Action: Terminate the call after two repetitions of automated prompts, and mark it as an automated system. No further attempts to reach this number should be made unless a human interaction occurs in a future attempt.
    
    c. Proactive Timeout Setting
    Purpose: Introduce a fail-safe mechanism to end calls if no human interaction is detected within a reasonable timeframe.
    Action: Set a 60-second timeout on all calls. If no human answers or if automated prompts continue past this timeframe, the call should automatically end.
    
    d. Clear Script for Agents When Automated System is Suspected
    Script Line: Train agents to exit immediately when automated systems are detected.
    Agent Response: When the agent detects or suspects an automated system, they should say:
    “It seems like I’ve reached an automated system. I’ll try calling back at a different time. Thank you, and have a great day!”
    Training Reinforcement: Remind agents to listen for automation cues within the first few prompts and to follow the exit script.
    
    e. Guardrail for Identifying and Filtering Answering Machines
    Enhanced Indicators of Voicemail or Answering Machine: The system should be programmed to detect the following:
    “You have reached the voicemail of…”
    “Please leave your name, number, and a brief message…”
    Action: Terminate the call as soon as these phrases are detected and log as “voicemail.”
    
    f. Reduced Re-Call Attempts for Numbers Identified as Automated Systems
    Purpose: Limit repeated calls to numbers flagged as automated systems.
    Action: If a number is identified as an automated system on two separate call attempts, add it to a "do not reattempt" list to prevent future attempts, unless a human interaction is reported on any subsequent attempt.
    
    
    g. Voicemail Handling - End Call if Voicemail:
    If you've reached the voicemail and the person doesn't answer, you may end the call immediately:
    For example:
    - "The person you are trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone."
    - "You have reached the voicemail box of [number]. Please leave a message after the beep."
    - "Sorry, the person you are calling is not available right now. Please leave a message after the tone."
    - "Hi, you've reached the voicemail of [Name]. I'm unable to take your call right now, but please leave your name, number, and a brief message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you!"
